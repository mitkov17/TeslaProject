# Spring boot - TeslaProject

Spring MVC app about electric vehicles.


## Description
The main purpose of the application is to combine the
review part of electric vehicles and the online store of 
electric vehicles using Spring framework. I have used Spring MVC,
Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL 
database, on the front-end part I used HTML&CSS, Thymeleaf, BootStrap and 
some JQuery for validation.
