lineup.modelS.more5=On March 30, 2018, Tesla recalled approximately 123,000 Model S vehicles built through April 2016 to replace power steering parts. This was due to the fact that the hydraulic booster bolts are susceptible to corrosion in the cold season. This effect is due to salt, which is used to prevent icing on the roads. Tesla began deliveries with 1,000 limited-edition Signature and Signature Performance sedans equipped with 85 kWh batteries and costing $95,400 and $105,400, respectively.
lineup.modelS.more6=Initially, Tesla planned to start production of cars with 60 kWh (335 km) and 40 kWh (260 km) batteries in 2013, but due to low demand from the 40 kWh model, it was decided to abandon them. .
lineup.modelS.more7=In June 2013, the company showed the Model S being recharged by automatic battery replacement. During the demonstration, the procedure was shown to take approximately 90 seconds, more than twice as fast as filling a full tank of a comparable gasoline vehicle. According to company president Elon Musk, "slow" (20 minutes for a 50% battery) charge of the Model S battery at the company's gas stations will remain free, while a quick replacement will cost the car owner about $ 60-80, which is approximately the same as the cost of a full tank of gas.
lineup.modelS.more8=However, in the future, it was decided to abandon plans for automatic battery change in favor of developing the Tesla Superchargers gas station network. Only vehicles sold before January 22, 2017 will enjoy lifetime free unlimited fast charging at Tesla Superchargers stations; cars sold after January 2017 will receive 400 kWh of free fast charging per year, above this amount, the owner will have to pay the cost of electricity consumed during fast charging.
lineup.modelS.more9=In 2016, the Tesla Model S received an updated design, partly more similar to the Model 3. In 2017, there was also some updating of the model range and now only versions 75, 75D, 100D, P100D are available for sale (the numbers indicate battery capacity in kWh, D - four-wheel drive, P - performance version).
