lineup.semi.brief=On November 16, 2017, Tesla held a presentation of the Tesla Semi electric tractor, the production of which will begin in 2021. The range of an electric truck is approximately 800 km (possibly 900 km) with a load of 40 tons.
lineup.cybertruck.brief=On November 21, 2019, the company introduced the Tesla Cybertruck electric pickup. Five days after the presentation, the car collected 250,000 pre-orders.
lineup.roadster.more1=Sports electric car, the first car of the company. The official presentation took place on July 19, 2006 in Santa Monica, California.
lineup.roadster.more2=Tesla Motors has held a competition to select the type of planned two Tesla Roadsters issued by British sports car manufacturer Lotus. The cars have been received.
lineup.roadster.more3=The first 1000 Tesla Roadsters were made within one month. The price of one car was $100,000. Serial production began in March 2008.
lineup.roadster.more4=This model was sold until 2012, since the contract with Lotus for the supply of 2500 cars expired at the end of 2011. The company stopped accepting bids on the US market in August 2011. The next generation of this model is scheduled to be introduced in 2019.
lineup.roadster.more5=Serial production, according to the company, began on March 17, 2008, although actual deliveries to customers began a few months later.
lineup.roadster.more6=By September 2009, 700 roadsters had been sold.
lineup.roadster.more7=In 2010, the company began manufacturing and selling RHD vehicles for the UK, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore markets. In the same year, the Tesla Roadster 2.5 version was introduced.
lineup.roadster.more8=In May 2010, Tesla Motors received a $50 million investment from Toyota to purchase the abandoned NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, formerly owned by Toyota.
lineup.roadster.more9=The contract with Lotus for the supply of 2,500 cars expired at the end of 2011. The company stopped accepting bids on the US market in August 2011. Production of the Tesla Roadster model was discontinued in January 2012. In the restyled version of the Roadster 2.5, which was presented in the summer of 2012 in Goodwood, the car received a modified grille, front and rear bumpers.
lineup.roadster.more10=September 29, 2014 Tesla Motors announced a minor model update. The new version was called Tesla Roadster 3.0. Improved aerodynamics, increased battery capacity to 70 kWh and tires with lower rolling resistance have increased autonomy to 644 km (400 miles).
lineup.roadster.more11=A new generation of Roadster built on the same platform as the Model 3 is scheduled for release in 2019.
lineup.roadster.more12=At the 2010 Detroit International Auto Show, a commemorative copy of the Tesla Roadster was shown. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company has produced 1,000 Tesla Roadsters. The 1,000th Tesla Roadster features a unique interior trim with carbon inserts. Its price is 175 thousand dollars and the proceeds from its sale will be used for charitable purposes.
lineup.modelS.more1=The concept car was presented March 26, 2009 in the town of Hawthorne, California. The five-door hatchback is being developed under the former designation "Whitestar" by the company's branch in Detroit. After the completion of design work, the factory should produce in California initially 10,000, later - 25,000 cars of the model.
lineup.modelS.more2=Delivery of vehicles to the United States began on June 22, 2012. Initially, two versions were offered: 60 and 85 kWh, equipped with a single electric motor located on the rear axle. Then, on October 9, 2014, an option with electric motors on each axle appeared, and already from April 8, 2015, the company completely abandoned the single-engine configuration and the 60 kWh version. From now on, all produced cars are equipped with two electric motors, all-wheel drive and in the basic version are equipped with a 70 kWh battery. The starting price starts at $75,750 in the US. Depending on the configuration, without recharging, the car will be able to drive 442, 502 and 480 kilometers.
lineup.modelS.more3=On November 12, 2012, the car received the "Car of the Year" award from the American magazine Motor Trend.
lineup.modelS.more4=Deliveries of S and X models in 2015 and 2016:
lineup.modelS.more5=On March 30, 2018, Tesla recalled approximately 123,000 Model S vehicles built through April 2016 to replace power steering parts. This was due to the fact that the hydraulic booster bolts are susceptible to corrosion in the cold season. This effect is due to salt, which is used to prevent icing on the roads. Tesla began deliveries with 1,000 limited-edition Signature and Signature Performance sedans equipped with 85 kWh batteries and costing $95,400 and $105,400, respectively.
lineup.modelS.more6=Initially, Tesla planned to start production of cars with 60 kWh (335 km) and 40 kWh (260 km) batteries in 2013, but due to low demand from the 40 kWh model, it was decided to abandon them. .
lineup.modelS.more7=In June 2013, the company showed the Model S being recharged by automatic battery replacement. During the demonstration, the procedure was shown to take approximately 90 seconds, more than twice as fast as filling a full tank of a comparable gasoline vehicle. According to company president Elon Musk, "slow" (20 minutes for a 50% battery) charge of the Model S battery at the company's gas stations will remain free, while a quick replacement will cost the car owner about $ 60-80, which is approximately the same as the cost of a full tank of gas.
lineup.modelS.more8=However, in the future, it was decided to abandon plans for automatic battery change in favor of developing the Tesla Superchargers gas station network. Only vehicles sold before January 22, 2017 will enjoy lifetime free unlimited fast charging at Tesla Superchargers stations; cars sold after January 2017 will receive 400 kWh of free fast charging per year, above this amount, the owner will have to pay the cost of electricity consumed during fast charging.
lineup.modelS.more9=In 2016, the Tesla Model S received an updated design, partly more similar to the Model 3. In 2017, there was also some updating of the model range and now only versions 75, 75D, 100D, P100D are available for sale (the numbers indicate battery capacity in kWh, D - four-wheel drive, P - performance version).
lineup.modelX.more1=On February 9, 2012, the company introduced a prototype of a new model - a crossover called Tesla Model X. At the same time, Elon Musk said that production of the model is planned to begin in 2013. It was originally planned that small batches would be delivered at the end of 2014, and the full production of the model would begin in 2015. However, in February 2014, it was announced that the start of deliveries is expected only in the second quarter of 2015. In November, the start of deliveries was again postponed, this time to the third quarter of 2015.
lineup.modelX.more2=Compared to the Model S, the following changes have been made: a 3rd row of seats has been added, automatically opening rear doors up for passengers to enter the 2nd and 3rd row, the ability to order a model with two motors.
lineup.modelX.more3=In the 1st quarter of 2016, 2400 Tesla Model X were sold.
lineup.modelX.more4=Among the reasons for the delay in the release of the Tesla Model X were problems with gull-wing doors and engine cooling.
lineup.modelX.more5=Customers who reserved it more than three years ago and made a deposit of $40,000 will be the first to receive the car. The pre-order was issued by about 25 thousand people, the waiting time for deliveries for new buyers is from 8 to 12 months. Tesla expects crossovers to make up half of its future sales.
lineup.modelX.more6=Tesla Motors plans to expand its audience to include women with children and positions the Model X as "the safest SUV ever" and a family car for traveling (the car can pull a caravan weighing more than two tons). In general, the segment of expensive SUVs in August 2015 grew in the US by 17%, five times better than the car market.
lineup.modelX.more7=In 2016, the Tesla Model X will begin to be assembled at the company's European plant in Tilburg, the Netherlands.
lineup.model3.more1=The Model 3 was originally named Model E and BlueStar, with the current name announced on July 15, 2014. It was expected that the model will be presented in March 2016.
lineup.model3.more2=On 30 July 2007, Martin Ebergartd revealed that the car would go on sale by 2012. The expected price of the model in the US was no more than $ 30,000 [source not specified 1090 days.
lineup.model3.more3=Model 3 was introduced on April 1, 2016. In the first week, 325,000 people booked the car with a $1,000 deposit. Such a significant volume of orders should have led to an adjustment in the company's production plans, Musk said.
lineup.model3.more4=Production started in 2017. The price of the standard version is $ 35,000, the range in the base model is 350 km. The car is 20% more compact than the Model S.
lineup.model3.more5=Initially, the electric car was supposed to be called the Tesla Model E, but Ford sued Tesla Motors, which they won, gaining the right to the Model E name.
lineup.model3.more6=On April 1, 2016, on the day of the presentation of the prototype model, reservations were opened. By the beginning of the presentation, the company received 115,000 applications. In just the first day, 180,000 people reserved the car, making a deposit of one thousand dollars. This number exceeded the company's total car sales in history. The number of orders for the first three days reached 276 thousand, for the first week - 325 thousand, and by May 16, 2016 it reached 373 thousand. A day after the start of the reservation, Elon Musk announced that the company would be forced to revise its own production plan.
lineup.model3.more7=On May 19, it became known that Tesla Motors will sell its own shares for $1.4 billion and use the funds raised to expand production to 500,000 vehicles by 2018.
lineup.model3.more8=On May 31, 2016, at the annual meeting of shareholders, Elon Musk announced that Model 3 owners will pay for the use of Supercharger's proprietary network of charging stations or must purchase the corresponding option. The reason for this decision, the company called the desire to minimize the initial cost of the car.
lineup.model3.more9=On June 2, Musk revealed that development of the Model 3 is nearly complete and the company plans to complete development in six weeks, leaving any new ideas for future versions. It was also announced that an event dedicated to the Model 3 will take place before the end of 2016. The Verge suggests that it was about the presentation of a production-ready version of the electric car.
lineup.model3.more10=On July 28, 2017, the first 30 production Tesla Model 3s were presented to journalists and employees of the company. Priority in the queue for receipt went to the company's employees.
lineup.model3.more11=The first deliveries not related to the company to customers were planned for November-December 2017. Deliveries of the $35,000 standard Tesla Model 3 were planned to begin in late 2017, with 2-motor versions (D) to be delivered in the spring of 2018, later with improved performance (PD). The first deliveries of the Tesla Model 3 outside the United States were planned to begin at the end of 2018, and the release of the right-hand drive version only in 2019.
lineup.model3.more12=In Q3 2017, 260 Tesla Model 3s were produced.
lineup.model3.more13=In the 4th quarter of 2017, 2425 vehicles were produced.
lineup.model3.more14=In the 1st quarter of 2018, 9766 cars were produced.
lineup.model3.more15=In the 2nd quarter of 2018, 28,578 vehicles were produced. Until Q2 2018, only the Long Range version with one motor (RWD) was in production.
lineup.model3.more16=In the 2nd quarter of 2018, production and deliveries of the version with two motors and improved performance began. All of the above versions have an estimated range of 310 miles (500 km).
lineup.model3.more17=In the 3rd quarter of 2018, 53,239 vehicles were produced, and more electric vehicles with two motors were produced than with one. On October 13, 2018, the Tesla Model 3 electric car rolled off the assembly line with serial number 100,000.
lineup.model3.more18=In the 4th quarter of 2018, 61,394 vehicles were produced, for a total of 145,846 Model 3s in 2018. Thus, the Model 3 became the best-selling electric car in 2018, beating the Nissan Leaf and BAIC EC. And this despite the fact that in 2018 the price of the most affordable modifications of the Model 3 was from $45,000 (the production of the basic version at a price of $35,000 is planned to be launched in 2019), and sales outside of North America have not yet begun.
lineup.model3.more19=In the 1st quarter of 2019, 62,950 Model 3s were produced, in the second quarter of 2019 - 72,531 Model 3s. In the first quarter of 2019, Model 3 sales began outside North America, primarily in Europe and China. In the first and second quarters of 2019, only left-hand drive cars with expensive trim levels were available in Europe. The first RHD Model 3s arrived in the UK in late June/early July 2019.
lineup.modelY.more1=Mid-range electric crossover introduced in March 2019. Series production began at the Fremont factory in January 2020, with customer deliveries on March 13, 2020.
lineup.modelY.more2=The first mention of the Tesla Model Y electric crossover dates back to 2015-2016: then Elon Musk sometimes promised Falcon Wings doors, thought about his own platform for the novelty, talked about the new plant. However, pragmatism and the desire to put the electric car into production as soon as possible won out: the Tesla Model Y crossover was built using Tesla Model 3 components (the two electric cars are technically 75% related), the rear doors were made in the usual way, and the first Tesla Model Y came from the USA. Which, however, does not change the fact: Tesla Model Y is a completely independent model.
lineup.modelY.more3=First of all, the Tesla Model Y electric crossover is slightly larger than the Tesla Model 3 sedan in size. So, the length is 4.75 m, the width is 1.92 m, and the body height differs most of all - 1.62 m. Plus, the crossover received a 2.89-meter wheelbase and a 17-centimeter ground clearance (167 mm, to be exact) . At the same time, both cars are as similar as possible in front and behind - it’s not even an hour to confuse them: headlights and lanterns are similar, similar contours of the front bumper and smooth hood, only the rear bumper has changed slightly in the lower part. When looking at the sidewall, the differences are more noticeable. First of all, the higher “dome” of the roof is immediately noticeable. In addition, the Tesla Model Y crossover received noticeable enlarged rear windows. Perhaps useful for third-row passengers. Yes, yes, the manufacturer claims an optional 7-seater saloon for the Tesla Model Y, which also distinguishes the crossover from the sedan.
lineup.modelY.more4=The front panel is also almost identical to the Tesla Model 3: a massive wooden insert, a horizontal 15-inch display, the absence of the usual instruments and ventilation deflectors. Instead of the latter, there is a gap in the entire width of the cabin, through which air is supplied. The minimalist front seats and door cards are similar: neutral gray color scheme, Alcantara insert, glossy black buttons. A lot of gloss and on the center console - two roomy boxes are covered with covers with a microlift. In general: everything is familiar and recognizable regarding the Tesla Model 3.
lineup.modelY.more5=But one has only to change seats back - and you will immediately see the difference. Even not so: you will not see - but you will feel. With my legs and feet, for which at last plenty of space has been offered. Once again I affirm: the crossover body is optimal for an electric car with a battery in the bottom. So you can provide a higher landing for second-row passengers, install the front seats higher - and, as a result, win legroom, knees, feet. Here is the first important advantage of the crossover over the Tesla Model 3 sedan. And if you add a panoramic roof, adjustable rear sofa for tilt, ventilation deflectors and heating for passengers, then the Tesla Model Y electric car looks good at all. That's just - again "minimalism". Don't see the sofa heating buttons in the photo? They are not: the rear sofa heating is controlled via the central display in the front of the cabin. This has both advantages and disadvantages. Minus - passengers cannot turn on / off the heating themselves. Plus, it’s convenient for the driver to turn off the heating: for example, after dropping off the children at the school.
lineup.modelY.more6=Now the second important advantage of the Tesla Model Y and its body type: the trunk. The sloping rear door rises high and opens a huge opening through which it is convenient to load bulky items into the trunk. With a 5-seater saloon, the trunk volume is about 500 liters, and if you fold the second row of seats, you will get 1,926 liters. Plus, two niches in the underground (for charging wires or a set of motorists), plus an electric trunk lid, plus buttons for folding the rear seats ... Still, the trunk curtain would not hurt - but it’s just not there. But there is a second small trunk under the hood.
lineup.semi.more1=On November 16, 2017, Tesla held a presentation of the Tesla Semi electric tractor, the production of which will begin in 2021. The range of an electric truck is approximately 800 km (possibly 900 km) with a load of 40 tons.
lineup.semi.more2=Although the vehicle is sometimes referred to as the world's first representative of the electric truck class, it was introduced later by the MFTBC E-Fuso Vision One.
lineup.semi.more3=Truck development is led by Jerome Guillen, former Tesla S program director and vice president of vehicle engineering.
lineup.semi.more4=Initially, the presentation of the truck was scheduled for September 2017. On October 4, 2017, three weeks before the official announcement, a Reddit user posted a photo of a car that could be a Tesla truck, but the company declined to comment on the photo. During speeches at the presentation of the Semi model, the founder of the company noted that the production of such an electric truck will be a new step towards freeing the economy from the use of fossil fuels. At the presentation, which took place on November 16, 2017, the technical characteristics of the truck became known: on a single battery charge, it can travel up to 800 kilometers; unloaded Semi can accelerate to 100 km / h in 5 seconds, with a full load (36 tons) - in 20 seconds; cabin drag coefficient (Cx) is declared at 0.36. It takes 40 minutes to fully charge the battery (80% charge in 30 minutes).
lineup.semi.more5=The truck belongs to the 8th class (according to the American classification) with a maximum permitted weight of more than 15 tons. Truck windows are made of special reinforced glass and are characterized by increased strength.
lineup.semi.more6=The company is going to test the work of a caravan of cars in an unmanned mode (2017) in the desert of Nevada. At the end of January 2018, evidence emerged that the company began testing the truck on public roads in Sunnyvale, California.
lineup.semi.more7=The release of Tesla Semi was originally planned to begin in 2019. The start of production was later pushed back to 2020.
lineup.semi.more8=On June 9, 2020, Elon Musk said that the electric tractor is ready: “It's time to do everything possible and bring the Tesla Semi Truck to mass production. So far, it has been limited, which has allowed us to improve it.” As a result, on June 10, for the first time in history, Tesla shares began to cost more than $1,000 a share, and the company's capitalization exceeded $185 billion. According to this indicator, Tesla bypassed the Japanese Toyota, becoming the most valuable automaker in the world.
lineup.cyber.more1=On November 21, 2019, the company introduced the Tesla Cybertruck electric pickup. Five days after the presentation, the car collected 250,000 pre-orders.
lineup.cyber.more2=It has a power reserve of 400-800 km, as well as an air suspension that adjusts to the load. There is an option for tightness and sockets in the back for 110 and 220 volts. Production is scheduled for the end of 2021.
lineup.cyber.more3=In 2012 and 2013, Musk discussed building a pickup truck similar to the Ford F-250. In early 2014, Musk predicted 4-5 years before building such a machine.
lineup.cyber.more4=In 2016, Musk talked about creating a pickup truck with completely new properties. It is possible to create a frame and suspension to create a pickup truck or a small van. In late 2017, the size was determined to be at least a Ford F-150 with a game-changing feature. In the process of rolling out the Tesla Semi and Tesla Roadster in November 2017, they showed a picture of a pickup truck capable of carrying a pickup truck. The ideas of this pickup have been worked out for 5 years at least.
lineup.cyber.more5=In late 2018, Tesla was working on two facets of its pickup truck. The first facet is the use of a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter base with Tesla added electric powertrain, battery and electronics. The second facet is the production of Tesla's own pickup truck, which takes more time. The prototype of this van was rejected during the preparation for the show in 2019.
lineup.cyber.more6=In March 2019, immediately after the launch of the Tesla Model Y, Elon Musk showed a picture of a pickup truck and said that it would be in cyberpunk style and not everyone would like it because of its futuristic forms and the style of a personal protected vehicle.
lineup.cyber.more7=During the presentation, which took place on November 21, 2019, Musk demonstrated the materials from which the Tesla Cybertruck is made. And it is stainless steel and extra strong glass. The extra-strong glass did not break in the test right at the presentation, but when Franz von Holzhausen tried to break the windows in the car with a metal ball, they broke. Musk joked that "he has a lot to work on." And that "we will erase it on video."
lineup.cyber.more8=Before the end of the presentation, Musk showed Tesla ATV - an all-electric ATV. He was rolled into a Tesla Cybertruck on a ramp and, moreover, he could be charged from it. (from a 120 volt outlet);
lineup.cyber.more9=All Cybertruck models have the following features: 250 kW Supercharge, autopilot, spring suspension, 110 and 220 volt outlets. Cars have an exoskeleton (bearing body structure) in contrast to the frame in conventional pickups. Like all other Tesla cars, autopilot can be ordered by paying an additional $7,000 to the price of the entire configuration.
lineup.cyber.more10=Single motor RWD // range 482 km // acceleration 0-100 km/h less than 6.5 seconds // Top speed 170 km/h // load capacity 1587 kilograms // trailer weight 3400 kilograms // price $39,900 //Dual motor AWD // range 600 km // acceleration 0-100 km/h less than 4.5 seconds // top speed 193 km/h // load capacity 1587 kg // trailer weight over 4535 kg // price $49,900 // Tri motor AWD // range over 800 km // acceleration 0-100 km/h in less than 2.9 seconds // top speed 210 km/h // load capacity 1587 kg // trailer over 6350 kg // price $69,900 // Additionally, Tesla confirms the following dimensions for all models: trunk volume 2.8 cubic meters. Length 198 cm. Clearance up to 40 cm. Angle of arrival 35 degrees. Departure angle 28 degrees.
lineup.cyber.more11=Standard model will use variable air suspension to compensate for load variations and will also have all-wheel drive. It will have inverters on board to support 110 and 220 volt outlets, allowing it to take advantage of the machine's power without a portable generator. The air compressor needed for the air suspension is also included. Cameras in the car allow automatic parallel parking.
lineup.cyber.more12=Options for the battery allow you to change the range of travel from one full charge from 400 to 800 km. The battery capacity is approximately 100 kWh. The driver's seat is so large that it allows a very large person to sit in it. The cockpit can be protected from shrapnel. The UpShift blog points to its weight of 2700 kilograms and the power of 775 horsepower.
lineup.cyber.more13=Optionally available is a fully sealed cab, which will allow the Cybertruck to be used as an amphibious vehicle.
